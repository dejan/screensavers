## Screensavers

> In some ways screen savers are the perfect program because they
> almost always start from scratch and they do something pretty and
> there's never a version 2.0. There's very rarely a bug in a screen
> saver. It crashes - oh, there's a divide-by-zero and you fix that.
> But no one is ever going to ask for a new feature in a screen saver.
> "I wish it was more yellow". You're not going to get a bug report
> like that. It is what it is. So that's why I've always written those
> for fun. They make this neat result and you don't have to think about
> them too much. They don't haunt you.
